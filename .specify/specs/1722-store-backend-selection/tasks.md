- [x] T1 — `store-config.ts` with aliases, conflict, persist default, resolvers, redaction. Acceptance: matrix unit tests (memory default off; `PERSIST=true` memory on; postgres selected → on; explicit `false` wins; missing URL fails fast naming both variables).
- [x] T2 — `configuration.ts` reads `resolvePersistSearch`. Acceptance: our deployment env → `false`.
- [x] T3 — `StoreModule.forActive({ providers })`. Acceptance: module test resolves a backend that injects a config token.
- [x] T4 — Bootstrap factory providers (sqlite path, postgres lazy Prisma + connect + disconnect) and production warning gated on persistence. Acceptance: factory tests.
- [x] T5 — `scripts/store-postgres.ts` + npm scripts. Acceptance: `migrate` applied `0_init` to a real PostgreSQL 16 database.
- [x] T6 — Postgres harness via `EVER_JOBS_TEST_PG_URL`; boot-path integration test. Acceptance: conformance + boot tests green against the throwaway cluster; unreachable URL → `ERR_STORE_BACKEND_DOWN`, password absent from the message.
- [x] T7 — Dockerfile best-effort generate + `openssl`. Acceptance: reviewed; not built in this lane (recorded).
- [x] T8 — Docs: README "Storage backends" with the env matrix and forker walkthrough, `.env.example`, `docs/log.md`, `docs/index.md`, Q-102.

Review fixes (2026-09-25):

- [x] T9 — Postgres set-based `upsertMany` + `putAllMany` (FR-12, FR-13), `transactionOptions` from env (FR-14). Acceptance: `RUN_PG_TESTS` 10 000-row case green through the production client constructor; re-persist reports all `updated` and leaves unchanged observations untouched; conformance suite still green.
- [x] T10 — SQLite chunked prepared-statement writes with event-loop yields (FR-15). Acceptance: 33 000-row `upsertMany` + `putAllMany` succeed (red before: `too many SQL variables`); an event-loop probe runs before `upsertMany` resolves; conformance suite still green.
- [x] T11 — Aggregator: `putAllMany` when available, otherwise `putAll` with ≤ 8 in flight; failures logged with a count and never flip `persisted`. Acceptance: aggregator unit tests.
- [x] T12 — `resolveStoreWriteTuning` + bootstrap wiring + docs (`README`, `.env.example`). Acceptance: store-config tests; bootstrap test sees `transactionOptions` passed to the Prisma constructor.
