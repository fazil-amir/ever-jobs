## 1. Problem Statement

Two things callers ask for cannot be expressed in one search today.

**Several places.** "Backend engineer in New York, Chicago and Austin" takes three requests. Each one
pays the whole fan-out, gets its own cache entry and its own dedup pass, and the caller merges the
results. Every plugin understands exactly one `input.location`; about 850 company/ATS plugins fetch
the whole board and filter by location substring locally, and cap at `resultsWanted` *inside* that
loop — so "call once without a location and post-filter" returns the wrong window.

**Things to leave out.** Nothing in the REST DTO, GraphQL input, CLI or MCP tool lets a caller say
"drop jobs that mention X". The naive version is wrong in predictable ways, measured over 2,365 real
titles on a large public ATS board:

| Term | Bare-substring hits | Whole-token hits | Dropped only by substring (all false positives) |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `sci` | 19 | 0 | "Research Scientist", "Flight Sciences Engineer" |
| `poly` | 2 | 0 | "… (Polymeric Ablatives)" |
| `lead` | 130 | 123 | "Compliance Leader", "Senior Leadership Recruiter" |

Descriptions arrive as entity-escaped HTML, requirements are phrased in words ("Top Secret security
clearance with … Polygraph") rather than one acronym, and "No clearance required" must not count.

A live probe of a public job API with a server-side location filter showed that the location is a
real filter (New York 13,864 vs Chicago 9,650 results) and that 6 of 20 page-0 ids came back for
both cities — so a per-location fan-out yields distinct jobs *and* needs same-source duplicate
removal.

## 2. Goals

- `locations: string[]` on every search surface; the query runs once per location for every
  selected source, each call with the caller's own `offset` and `resultsWanted`.
- One failing location never discards another location's jobs; a source that refuses us (429,
  block, open breaker) is not asked for its remaining locations.
- Same posting, same source, two locations → one row, whether or not `?dedup=false`.
- `excludeTitleTerms`, `excludeKeywords`, `excludePresets` (first preset: `security_clearance`) as a
  per-request view filter after dedup.
- Callers that send none of the new fields see byte-identical behaviour, plugin inputs, cache keys
  and responses.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Per-location `country`/`distance`, tagging a job with the location that produced it, and
  one-upstream-request-for-all-locations per plugin (follow-ups).
- Pushing negative terms down into sources; back-filling to `resultsWanted` after exclusion;
  `excludeCompanies`.
- Changing any plugin. Plugins still see a single `input.location` and never see `locations`.
- A shared GET response memo for repeated identical board fetches (see D-03; follow-up).

## 4. User / Caller Stories

> As an **API caller**, I want **one request for several cities**, so that **I pay one fan-out and
> get one merged, de-duplicated result**.

> As a **job seeker without a clearance**, I want **to drop clearance-required roles without
> maintaining a word list**, so that **the list only shows jobs I can take**.

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement | Priority |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| FR-1  | `ScraperInputDto.locations?: string[]` (≤ 25 entries, ≤ 200 chars each, validated). No constructor default. | must |
| FR-2  | Resolution: `location` first, then `locations`; NFC + trim + whitespace collapse; case-insensitive de-dup keeping the first spelling; diacritics kept distinct; blanks/non-strings dropped. | must |
| FR-3  | Cap: `EVER_JOBS_SEARCH_MAX_LOCATIONS` (default 10, clamped to [1, 25]); entries over the cap become `location:<text>` `bad_input` diagnostic rows. | must |
| FR-4  | 0 or 1 resolved location → the legacy single-location path; `locations` absent → the input object is untouched. | must |
| FR-5  | ≥ 2 locations → per site, locations run sequentially (sites stay parallel under the existing pool), each call a fresh clone with `location` set and `locations` removed. | must |
| FR-6  | Polite stop: a 429 (thrown or in a swallowed `fetch_error` diagnostic), a `blocked` outcome or an open breaker ends that site's loop; the rest are reported as not attempted and counted as `location_skipped`. | must |
| FR-7  | Deadline checked before and raced during every location call; skipped locations report `timeout`. | must |
| FR-8  | Same-source identity de-dup across locations (site + id + jobUrl; either alone when the other is missing; neither → keep). | must |
| FR-9  | One diagnostic row per (site, location) carrying `location`; `site` stays the bare key. | must |
| FR-10 | Pause of `EVER_JOBS_SEARCH_LOCATION_INTERVAL_MS` (default 500, `0` disables) between consecutive attempted location calls to one source. | should |
| FR-11 | Cache key: exclusion fields never keyed; `locations` keyed case-insensitively on the searched list **in caller order** (`location` first, duplicates dropped keeping the first; see §13); a one-entry list keys like `location`. | must |
| FR-12 | Exclusion matcher: whole tokens, phrases, trailing-`*` prefix (≥ 3 chars), aliases (`sr`/`snr`↔`senior`, `jr`↔`junior`), negation-aware in the same clause, HTML-safe, linear, never a regex over caller input; separator-less scripts use a literal substring. | must |
| FR-13 | Exclusions run in the aggregator after dedup; a cluster is dropped when any member matches; persistence still receives every canonical record. | must |
| FR-14 | REST `exclusion_metrics` (`samples` only with `?diagnostics`), GraphQL `exclusionMetrics`, CLI stderr summary, MCP `excluded` — each present only when an exclusion field was supplied. `/analyze` analyses the filtered set. | must |
| FR-15 | CLI `--locations`, `--exclude-title`, `--exclude-keyword`, `--exclude-preset` on `search` and `compare`; MCP `locations`, `exclude_title_terms`, `exclude_keywords`, `exclude_presets`. | must |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement | Target |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| NFR-1 | Never more than one in-flight call per (search, source) from the location fan-out | 1 |
| NFR-2 | Exclusion matching worst case (50 terms × 8 tokens × 100 KB description) | < 200 ms per job |
| NFR-3 | Exclusion failure never fails a search | unfiltered list + `exclusion_error` |
| NFR-4 | Metrics cardinality | no `location` label; one new bounded status value |

## 7. Contracts

### 7.1 API / Interface

```ts
// packages/models
export const HARD_MAX_SEARCH_LOCATIONS = 25;
export const DEFAULT_MAX_SEARCH_LOCATIONS = 10;
export enum ExclusionPreset { SECURITY_CLEARANCE = 'security_clearance' }
class ScraperInputDto {
  locations?: string[];
  excludeTitleTerms?: string[];   // ≤ 50, ≤ 100 chars
  excludeKeywords?: string[];     // ≤ 50, ≤ 100 chars
  excludePresets?: ExclusionPreset[];
}

// packages/common
resolveSearchLocations(input, max?): { locations: string[]; overCap: string[] };
searchLocationsCacheKey(locations): string[];          // sorted; not the search cache key (§13)
searchLocationsOrderedCacheKey(locations): string[];   // caller order, first occurrence wins
clampMaxLocations(raw): number;
compileJobExclusions(spec): CompiledJobExclusions;
matchJobExclusion(job, compiled): ExclusionMatch | null;
applyJobExclusions(jobs, specOrCompiled): { kept; excluded; metrics };

// apps/api
class LocatedSourceDiagnosticDto extends SourceDiagnosticDto { location: string }
interface AggregateOptions { exclusions?: JobExclusionSpec | CompiledJobExclusions }
interface AggregateResult { exclusionMetrics?; excludedSamples?; exclusionError? }
```

REST response (additive, only when an exclusion field was supplied):

```jsonc
"exclusion_metrics": {
  "excluded_count": 12, "excluded_raw_count": 15,
  "by_term": [{ "term": "security clearance", "source": "preset:security_clearance", "count": 9 }],
  "ignored_terms": [{ "term": "a*", "reason": "prefix_too_short" }],
  "samples": [{ "id": "…", "site": "…", "title": "…", "term": "ts sci", "source": "…", "field": "description" }]
}
```

### 7.2 Errors

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 400 (validation) | `locations` > 25 / entry > 200 chars / non-string; exclusion list > 50 / term > 100 chars / non-string; unknown preset |
| `ERR_EXCLUSION_FAILED` | The exclusion filter threw; the unfiltered list is returned with `exclusion_error` |

Ignored-term reasons (reported, never thrown): `empty`, `too_long`, `too_many_tokens`,
`prefix_too_short`, `over_limit`, `unknown_preset`.

## 8. Test Plan

- Unit: `search-locations.spec.ts`, `job-exclusion.spec.ts` (P1–P8 pitfalls, 40-title preset
  fixture, timing guards), `scraper-input-search-filters.spec.ts`.
- Service: `jobs.service.multi-location.spec.ts` — legacy path untouched, collapse, per-location
  clones, no shared cursor/budget, sequential-per-site/parallel-across-sites, isolation, polite stop
  (thrown 429/403, swallowed block/rate limit), no stop on 404/5xx, breaker, identity de-dup,
  deadline, cap, env fallback, routing, pause.
- Aggregator / API: `jobs.aggregator.exclusions.spec.ts`, `search-filters.api.spec.ts` (cache keys,
  response keys, pagination after exclusion, liveness only on kept jobs, `/analyze`, ValidationPipe
  400s, resolver, GraphQL schema).
- CLI / MCP: `search-filters.command.spec.ts`, `tools-search-filters.spec.ts`.
- Live: `apps/api/__tests__/search-multi-location.e2e-spec.ts` — two upstream GETs, one per location; exclusion invariants on
  the same live result.

## 9. Open Questions

Recorded for `docs/questions.md` (integrator), each with the default this change ships:

- Q-A Default location cap — **10** (hard 25), operator-tunable.
- Q-B Stop a source's remaining locations after a refusal — **yes**.
- Q-C Tag jobs with the search location(s) that produced them — **no** (adds a field to REST,
  GraphQL and CSV).
- Q-D Allow `locations` with the catalogue-wide default site selection — **allowed**; the deadline
  bounds it and skips appear in diagnostics.
- Q-E Default pause between one source's location calls — **500 ms**, until the crawl-policy host
  limiter and a shared GET memo land. (Both have landed: the memo in the review fixup, the host
  limiter with the Spec 1690 merge on 2026-09-26. The 500 ms default is kept as an extra per-source
  gap on top of the limiter; `0` leaves the pacing to the limiter and the plugin's declared gap.)

## 10. Decisions

- **D-01 — The fan-out lives in `JobsService.searchJobsWithDiagnostics`, not the aggregator.** The
  controller calls the service directly; one change there covers REST, GraphQL, CLI, `/analyze` and
  `JobsAggregator.aggregate`.
- **D-02 — Identity key is site + id + jobUrl.** An id-only key would collapse different postings
  from plugins that derive `id` from the row index; requiring both keeps them apart while the same
  posting under two locations still collapses.
- **D-03 — No shared GET memo in this change** (superseded by the review fixup, T13). Collapsing
  identical board fetches needs a hook in the shared HTTP client, which this change did not own.
  Instead calls are sequential per source with a configurable pause (FR-10), bounded by the cap and
  the deadline. The review fixup added the scoped memo (`runWithHttpMemo`, GET and POST, one scope
  per source location loop, `EVER_JOBS_SEARCH_LOCATION_MEMO`) and plugin-declared request gaps (T14).
- **D-04 — Located rows are a subclass in `apps/api`.** `LocatedSourceDiagnosticDto` adds
  `location` without touching the shared DTO; rows serialise with the extra field and consumers that
  group by `site` are unaffected.
- **D-05 — Exclusion is a view.** The cache stores the raw fan-out and persistence receives every
  canonical record; `per_source` keeps reporting fan-out counts (pre-dedup, pre-exclusion).
- **D-06 — Presets have no bare `sci`/`poly`/`secret`,** and "enhanced reliability" is not a
  preset term (it reads as an SRE phrase); "reliability status" covers the vetting level.
- **D-07 — Unknown presets are dropped, not failed, outside the validated REST path** (CLI, MCP,
  direct helper use) and reported as `unknown_preset`.
- **D-08 — Exclusion keys only when supplied.** An empty list is still "supplied": the metrics key
  appears (zeroed) and nothing is removed.

## 12. Merge with Spec 1690 — crawl policy (2026-09-26)

`feat/http-politeness` (Specs 1690/1691) was merged into this branch. What changed for this spec:

- **Memo inside the crawl-policy client.** `HttpClient.request` resolves the request's crawl
  policy and runs the literal egress check, then consults the memo, then robots.txt, the host
  limiter, retries and the network. A memo hit sends nothing and takes no rate-limit slot; a miss
  runs the whole crawl pipeline, so the memo never bypasses the egress guard, the redirect pin or
  the pacing for a real request. The key adds, beyond method / URL / query / body / headers: the
  wire identity (User-Agent, `From`, client-hint stripping), the per-request `crawl` override,
  `robotsTxt`, `blockPrivateNetworks` and the client's egress allow-list, the redirect pin's
  hosts, insecure TLS and `maxRedirects`. A request with its own agents, axios `proxy`,
  `beforeRedirect` or adapter is not memoised. Only 2xx answers are kept (a 429 the caller
  accepted through `validateStatus` is not); bodies are copied per caller and `Set-Cookie` is
  replayed into the calling client's jar, as before.
- **Location calls in the scrape context.** Every per-location call goes through `scrapeOne`, so
  it runs in its own scrape context — site, the plugin's `@SourcePlugin({ crawl })` manifest, the
  caller's crawl override (built once per search from the fields the caller actually sent), the
  caller's proxies — with its own `AbortController`. The search deadline aborts the in-flight
  location's requests (`EVER_JOBS_CRAWL_ABORT_ON_DEADLINE`) and the remaining locations are
  skipped by the deadline check; the aborted call is circuit-neutral and counted in the
  "abandoned N in-flight source(s)" warning.
- **Polite stop.** `rate_limited` — the crawl policy's `HostCoolingDownError` /
  `CrawlQueueTimeoutError`, thrown or reported in a swallowed diagnostic — stops a source's
  remaining locations like a 429 or a block; a robots.txt refusal (`blocked`) does too. The shared
  `refusalFromScrapeError` / `isRefusalDiagnostics` helpers that plugins use for their own detail
  walks treat `rate_limited` the same way.
- **Pacing.** The location pause (`EVER_JOBS_SEARCH_LOCATION_INTERVAL_MS`, raised to the plugin's
  `minRequestIntervalMs`) is kept; the per-host limiter now paces every request on top of it.

## 13. Review fix: the cache key keeps the caller's location order (2026-09-26)

The first build keyed `locations` order-insensitively (`searchLocationsCacheKey` sorts). The merge
is not order-insensitive: `runLocationLoop` searches the locations in caller order and
`mergeLocationOutcomes` keeps the **first** same-source duplicate (a refusal also skips the
locations after it). `["A", "B"]` and `["B", "A"]` could therefore return different rows (the same
posting as fetched for A, or as fetched for B) yet shared one cache entry, so the second caller got
the first caller's winners.

- `searchCacheParams` now keys the resolved list with `searchLocationsOrderedCacheKey`: each entry
  normalised (NFC, trim, whitespace collapse) and lower-cased, blanks dropped, duplicates removed
  keeping the first occurrence, **order kept**. That is the list the service searches
  (`resolveSearchLocations`), in its order, lower-cased. `location` still folds in first, a
  one-entry list still keys like a plain `location`, case and whitespace variants of the same
  ordered list still share an entry, and diacritics stay distinct.
- `searchLocationsCacheKey` is kept (marked deprecated for the search cache) for callers that want
  set semantics.
- Only multi-location keys change; single-location and plain requests key exactly as before. An
  entry written under a sorted key is not found again and expires by its TTL. The feature is
  unreleased, so no migration is needed.
- Tests: `search-locations.spec.ts` (order, normalisation, first-wins parity with
  `resolveSearchLocations`), `search-filters.api.spec.ts` (reversed list gives a different key,
  respelled list the same key, duplicates, `location` folding, REST and GraphQL) and
  `jobs.service.multi-location.spec.ts` (one posting under both locations: the winner follows the
  order, and each key equals the order the service actually searched).
