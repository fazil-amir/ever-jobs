- [x] T1 — Audit every `jobUrl` / `jobUrlDirect` / `applyUrl` assignment in
  `packages/plugins/*/src`. Acceptance: count and classification derived from the AST
  (1,791 sites, 1,164 plugins), every flagged row read in code — notes.md.
- [x] T2 — `public-url.ts` in `@ever-jobs/common` (`API_URL_PATTERN`, `isApiLikeUrl`,
  `firstPublicUrl`). Acceptance: `public-url.spec.ts` 28/28.
- [x] T3 — ReliefWeb: never `entry.href`; public node page fallback. Acceptance:
  `reliefweb.job-url.spec.ts` 3/3.
- [x] T4 — NAV: never the feed `item.url`; arbeidsplassen ad page fallback; `applyUrl` set;
  non-URL `applicationUrl` text no longer becomes a link. Acceptance:
  `navjobs.job-url.spec.ts` 3/3.
- [x] T5 — HiringThing, Loxo, Bullhorn, Ceipal: public candidates and `companyUrl` before the
  legacy API link; Ceipal/Loxo `applyUrl` public-only. Acceptance: `*.job-url.spec.ts`
  4 + 4 + 3 + 5 cases, last-resort behaviour pinned by a test each.
- [x] T6 — Guard `scripts/__tests__/plugin-job-url-hosts.spec.ts`. Acceptance: 12/12;
  scans 1,165 plugins / 1,520 valued assignments; only the four named exceptions produce
  findings; red when SmartRecruiters' `job.ref` is reintroduced.
- [x] T7 — Red controls: the six adapter suites against the pre-fix services fail 13 of 22.
- [x] T8 — Docs: spec/plan/tasks/notes, `docs/index.md` row, `docs/log.md` entry, **Q-110**.
- [ ] T9 — (Q-110 follow-up) decide the last-resort policy for tenants with no public page,
  then either drop the four exceptions or keep them.
- [ ] T10 — (follow-up) Workday site-less fallback URL, Oracle `/careers/job/<id>`
  fallback, and Zwayam's `api.zwayam.com/job_preview/` link verified live.
- [x] T11 — Guard gap (mutant M7): follow links built into an intermediate record. Record keys
  `url` / `link` / `href` judged like link fields (request configs excepted); every URL-named
  helper's returns judged unless every caller only fetches the result. Acceptance: guard 17/17
  (5 new detection cases); tree: 1,165 plugins, 1,520 link assignments, 197 record links, 348
  URL-named link helpers, 93 fetch helpers, zero findings outside the named exceptions (Zwayam
  added as the fifth, D-04); mutants M7 (Carerix method helper), M8 (BreatheHR arrow helper),
  M9 (CVWarehouse template in a `Map`), M10 (Carerix inline record template) each pass the
  pre-T11 guard and fail after, restored with `git checkout`; new `carerix.job-url.spec.ts`
  3/3 (2 red under M7).
- [x] T12 — Prove the NAV fallback id (1 live GET). Acceptance: NAV's feed source shows list
  `id` = `_feed_entry.uuid` = `ad.uuid` and `ad_content.link` = `…/stillinger/stilling/<ad.uuid>`;
  the live ad page for one uuid answers 200 HTML with that uuid as *Stillingsnummer*;
  `navjobs.job-url.spec.ts` 5/5 (2 new cases pin it). No code change needed.
- [x] T13 — ReliefWeb v1 → v2 split out as Spec 1752.
