 * Crawl completeness of one fan-out (Spec 1721 / FR-15).
 *
 * The fan-out has two server-side bounds that stop it early: the wall-clock
 * deadline (`EVER_JOBS_FANOUT_DEADLINE_MS`, Spec 5026) and the raw-job ceiling
 * (`EVER_JOBS_MAX_JOBS_PER_SEARCH`, Spec 1720 / FR-12). Either one leaves
 * selected sources unscraped, and before this record the NDJSON `end` line
 * looked the same for a crawl that covered every source and for one that
 * covered half of them — so a consumer that treats "absent from a complete
 * crawl" as "the posting is gone" had no way to know when it must not.
 *
 * FR-20 adds the per-source view a consumer needs to decide expiry PER
 * SOURCE: which selected sources did not run cleanly (failed, partial,
 * skipped, cut at `resultsWanted`, or not queried in list mode). A crawl can
 * be `complete` and still have sources whose postings must not be expired.
 *
 * The record is reported on the NDJSON `end` line (additive fields) and cached
 * in the same entry as the raw fan-out (`./search-cache`, FR-19), so a cache
 * hit reports the completeness of the crawl that produced it. An incomplete
 * crawl is never cached (FR-20).
