/**
 * Default hybrid dedup engine — Spec 003 / FR-1.
 *
 * Pipeline (each stage further merges clusters from the previous stage):
 *
 *  1. {@link HashStrategy} — exact `canonicalJobId` bucketing (O(N), fast path).
 *  2. {@link MinHashStrategy} — MinHash + LSH near-duplicate detection on
 *     long-form text (description, falling back to title + company).
 *
 * Every merge either stage proposes passes the {@link MergeGate} (Spec 1724):
 * postings are only merged when their locations are compatible and their
 * employment types do not conflict, so one role posted per office (or per
 * program) keeps one record per office (or program).
 *
 * The service:
 *  - validates inputs (rejects entries missing `title` or `companyName`)
 *  - prepares each input once (canonical key + id)
 *  - runs strategies in order, unioning partitions via {@link UnionFind}
 *  - emits one `CanonicalJob` per cluster, picking the first observation as
 *    the field winner (replaced by `IMergeResolver` when Phase 4 lands)
 *  - returns a `DedupResult` envelope with assignments + metrics
 *
 * ## Cooperative scheduling
 *
 * Every pass below hands the event loop back once it has held it for
 * `DEFAULT_YIELD_BUDGET_MS` (see `./cooperative`). Without that, a ~6 900-job
 * batch is ~10.6 s of uninterrupted synchronous CPU on the same thread that
 * serves `GET /health`, which is what made Kubernetes' liveness probe kill the
 * pod. The yields change no output — every structure the passes touch is local
 * to the call.
 *
 * 🛑 `DedupMetrics.elapsedMs` is, and remains, **wall clock**. With yields it
 * now also counts the time the loop spent serving other requests, so under
 * concurrency it reads *higher* than the CPU the pass actually consumed. Read
 * it as "how long the caller waited", not "how much CPU dedup burned".

   * Before them, a pass held the thread start-to-finish, so two concurrent
   * `dedup()` calls were serialised by the runtime and only ever one working
   * set (`slots`, `buckets`, signatures) was live. Yielding removes that
   * accidental mutual exclusion: without this gate, K concurrent passes keep K
   * working sets resident simultaneously — measured +17 % peak heap at K=4 and
   * +67 % (+117 MB) at K=8 on a 2 500-job batch, and production batches are
   * ~10x that.
   *
   * This service runs with `--max-old-space-size=2560` in a 4Gi container and
   * has already aborted with `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit` (exit 139), so
   * trading peak heap for concurrency is exactly the wrong trade here. The
   * gate restores the old memory profile while keeping the win that motivated
   * the yields: the pass that holds the gate still hands the event loop back
   * every `DEFAULT_YIELD_BUDGET_MS`, so `GET /health` — and every other
   * request — is served throughout.
   *
   * Queuing cost is negligible in practice: this endpoint serves a handful of
   * searches an hour and the fan-out that produces the input already takes
   * ~150 s, dwarfing any wait here.
