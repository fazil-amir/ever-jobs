/**
 * Bridgewater Associates — Hedge fund (HQ: Westport, CT, USA).
 *
 * Source (Spec 1737): Greenhouse board, scraped in this order:
 *   - `bridgewater89` — https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/bridgewater89
 *     verified live 2026-09-24: 14 open postings.
 *
 * The plugin re-implements no parsing. It resolves the registered Greenhouse
 * source plugin from the PluginRegistry at runtime, delegates each board in
 * turn (sequentially, early-career boards first, each with the remaining
 * resultsWanted budget), then re-stamps the company identity (site,
 * companyName, id prefix) so every Greenhouse field fix is inherited and no
 * plugin imports a peer. The search term and every other caller input pass
 * through untouched, except credentials: auth is never forwarded to a third
 * party board.
 *
 * Tags: segment=quant-trading; industry=hedge-fund.
